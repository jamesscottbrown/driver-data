<div id="license-age">
    <h2>How old are driving licence holders?</h2>
    <p>There is a sudden surge in provisional driving license registrations <u id="age-17">at 17</u>, which gradually
        declines as people switch to full licenses. Provisional licenses for some vehicle types (such as mopeds) can be
        obtained by people under 16, but this makes
        up a very small fraction of all licenses</p>

    <p>There is a sudden step down in all license types <u id="age-70">at
        70</u>, after which licenses must be renewed every 3 years (rather than the 10 years for younger drivers).

<div id="license-sex-category">
    <h2>How many men and women hold each class of licence?</h2>
    <p>Some classes of license are far more common than others. The most common are held by similar numbers of men and
        women, but there are a number of less common licence types that are held almost exclusively by men (such as
        Class H - Tracked vehicles). Additionally, for some classes (such as A and H) there are far more provisional
        than full licenses. </p>

        license categories</a>.</p>

<div id="points-distribution">
    <h2>How many points do drivers have?</h2>

    <p>The most common (non-zero) number of points is 3, followed by 6 and 9. Some people have received far more than
        this:
        one person has 51 points.</p>

        less common numbers of points.</p>

</div>


<div id="points-distribution-age">
    <h2>How does number of points vary with age?</h2>

    <p> Young drivers have fewer points on average: they have had less opportunity to acquire them, and are perhaps
        initially more cautious because receiving 6 points within 2 years of passing the test would trigger automatic
        revocation of their license. </p>

    <p><b>Interactivity:</b> mouse-over a cell in the heat-map to see the corresponding value, and plots for people of
        the corresponding age or with the corresponding number of points. Click on the heat-map to lock these plots to a
        particular value, so that you cna mouse over their data points to see corresponding values.</p>

    <p>These plots show <i>the proportion of drivers of a particular age who have a particular number of points</i>
        (scaled to be per thousand drivers of that age).</p>

<div id="licence-districts">
    <h2>How does the proportion of provisional licenses differ between districts?</h2>

    <p>In a few postcode districts, approximately half of all driving licenses are provisional, but in others this
        figure is closer to 5%.</p>

    <p>These districts occupy the lower-right corner of this plot: those in which the proportion of licenses that are
        provisional is above a threshold are highlighted in
        yellow.
        Dragging the circle on the line adjusts this threshold.

<div id="points-map">
    <h2>How does the proportion of people with points on their license differ between districts?</h2>
    <p>Some postcode districts contain only a single licensed driver, and 100% of their drivers have points. The average
        figure is 6%. </p>
